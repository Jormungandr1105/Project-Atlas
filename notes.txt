Notes for my own sanity (I'm not an astrophysicist)

These notes are based in part on my (mis)understanding (I'm sure) of "Computing Planetary Positions" by Paul Schlyter.

Time represented in days since the start of the millennium

pretend sun orbits earth to make calcs easier

List of variables and their meanings:
N = Longitudinal Ascent Node
w = Argument of perigee/periapsis
i = inclination
a = mean distance
e = eccentricity
M = Mean anomaly
L* = mean longitude of *
M* = mean anomaly of *
